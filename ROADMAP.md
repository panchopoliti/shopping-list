## Current Project Stage
A Web App which uses a Google Spreadsheet as a dynamic database, and display a list of products to select before going shopping. This Spreadsheet is shared with all the house members, so they can easily modify and update it.

## Project Goal
Speed up the usual shopping process by creating a Web App, which allows people to select what they want to shop, out of a list of products they usually consume.

## Product Goal
The final release would count with user access, and a template creator of different list products. The user will create her usual product list, and everytime she wants to create a new shopping list, she will quickly setup her new list, out of her previous shops and her template of products.

Once the user is in the shop, she will check her list (made before going shopping), displayed in an email or/and in the app as a reminder for what she wanted to buy.

## Next Steps
+ Make offline first
+ Save for your next shopping time ( _new feature_ )
+ User Access
+ Connect it to a Database and display lists in App
+ Add search product box

## Initial Motivation
While shopping for me and members of my house, I found myself losing lot of time just choosing what should I buy. Before going shopping, we are used to have a proper shopping list. We were making it, out of previous lists in different devices and papers, and visualising what we would need for the week or the further days. That is why, this project started to speed up this process, and make the selection a more easier and satisfying experience.
